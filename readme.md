# William Sergio Minozzi 👋
### Senior Technical Consultant & WordPress Specialist | Bridging Technology and Business Strategy

<p align="left">
  📍 Living in the European Union | 🇮🇹 Citizenship: Italian (EU)
</p>

With over 25 years of international experience and an **MBA in Business Administration**, my career is dedicated to bridging deep technical expertise with a strategic business perspective. I don't just build technology; I ensure it drives growth and return on investment (ROI).

My focus is on **end-to-end technical ownership**. With a proven track record of over 30 custom WordPress solutions, I autonomously architect, build, and secure the entire technology stack—from *bare-metal* server configuration to advanced application security.
