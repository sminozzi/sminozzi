  üìç Living in the European Union | üáÆüáπ Citizenship: Italian (EU)

With over 25 years of international experience and an **MBA in Business Administration**, my career is dedicated to bridging deep technical expertise with a strategic business perspective. I don't just build technology; I ensure it drives growth and return on investment (ROI).

My focus is on **end-to-end technical ownership**. With a proven track record of over 30 custom WordPress solutions, I autonomously architect, build, and secure the entire technology stack‚Äîfrom *bare-metal* server configuration to advanced application security.
